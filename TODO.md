Todo list:

- [x] Setup the BERT mlm baseline
- [_] Setup multidialog bucketing
- [_] Setup visualization of speaker weights
- [_] Make the model save correctly on drive after a set number of steps
- [x] Make the model stackable layers with one layer of attention block each SAUTE layer to create hierarchical memory
- [x] Add evaluation based on accuracy and make validation set
- [_] Speedup model inference to be equivalent to transformers + O(n) maximum
